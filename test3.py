Iâ€™m on my feet ðŸ¦¶ for about 14 miles a day for 6 days a week. Does anyone know or any Nike enthusiast who can recommend me to some good sneakers? I currently only wear Pegasus or Pegasus trails and they seem to work wonders especially with my plantar fasciitis but Iâ€™m noticing that Iâ€™m breaking down the shoes a lot more faster than I thought. I like white and black style

Hey there! It sounds like youâ€™ve got quite the mileage on your feet, and itâ€™s awesome that the Pegasus line has been working wonders for you. Given your current needs, the Nike React Pegasus Trail 4 Gore-Tex Barely Grape Total Orange could be a fantastic match for your routine.
First off, since you're on your feet so much, the React midsole in this sneaker is a stellar feature. It offers exceptional cushioning and energy return, which means you'll feel that spring in your step even as you clock those 14 miles a day. This can be especially beneficial for managing plantar fasciitis, as it helps reduce the impact on your feet, making each step more comfortable and less stressful on your arches.
The Gore-Tex upper is another highlight, providing excellent water resistance. This is perfect if you're transitioning from indoors to outdoors or if your routes occasionally get a bit wet. No more worrying about soggy feet affecting your comfort or performance!
For durability, which seems to be a concern for you, the rugged design of the Trail 4 is built to withstand more intense wear. The black rubber outsole ensures reliable traction on a variety of surfaces, so whether you're on a trail or pavement, you can trust that your shoes will grip well and wear longer.
And style-wise, while the Barely Grape and Total Orange accents add a pop of color, the overall look still maintains a clean aesthetic with its white and black elements, aligning nicely with your color preference.

A smaller heel clip than on previous Invincible iterations provides structure and support in a more streamlined design. An ice blue mud guard sports a tonal embossed Nike swoosh that matches the one on the heel. A black heel tab compliments a black striped Nike swoosh on the quarter panel and a solid black Nike swoosh on the toe box. This upper gets springy support from a wider midsole composed of cream-colored Zoom X foam that returns energy with every step.\n\nWhat we appreciate most about this high-octane running shoe is the black rubber outsole interwoven with hits of blue. The lattice pattern allows the foam to expand and react to empower your stride. The Nike Invincible Run 3 White Cobalt Bliss was released on January 5, 2023 for $180 retail.",
