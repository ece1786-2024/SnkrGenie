1. I need something comfortable for walking around the city all day. | I'd also prefer something that's easy to slip on and off. | I'd like it to be versatile enough to wear with both casual and slightly dressy outfits.
2. Looking for shoes that I can wear both at the gym and casual outings. | I'd like them to be supportive during weightlifting. | And they should have a sleek design that looks good in public.
3. Need something for my daily morning jogs. | The area I jog in is quite hilly, so they need good grip. | I'd also love some bright colors for visibility.

# Style/Appearance Based
1. I want something that looks vintage but still modern. | Preferably with some neutral colors like beige or cream. | I like leather or suede materials for a classy look.
2. Looking for sneakers that aren't too flashy but still stylish. | I prefer monotone or subtle two-tone designs. | And they should match with a variety of outfits.
3. Want some cool streetwear vibes in my shoes. | I like high-top designs for a bold statement. | It would be nice if they had some graffiti-style elements.

# Comfort/Experience Based
1. My feet hurt after long walks, need something supportive. | Cushioning in the heel area is really important to me. | I'd also prefer shoes that aren't too heavy.
2. Want something light and breathable for summer. | I like mesh materials for maximum breathability. | I prefer pastel colors for a summer vibe.
3. Need shoes that don't make my feet sweaty. | Shoes with good airflow are a must. | I prefer natural materials that wick away moisture.

# Mixed Requirements
1. Want something comfortable but also looks good with jeans. | I'd prefer a classic low-profile design. | It would be great if they have some nice stitching details.

2. My ankles usually hurt when walking, need good support. | I need high-top shoes for extra ankle support. | The shoes should have extra padding around the ankle area.
3. Want something that won't make my feet tired during long shifts. | Cushioning in the sole is a must for comfort. | They also need to be slip-resistant for workplace safety.
