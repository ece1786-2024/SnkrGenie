About me- Iâ€™ve ran 5 marathons, currently training for a spring marathon, should BQ, and Iâ€™ve only ran in NB, Saucony and Brooks. Volume is 30-40 mpw, 1-2 speed/tempo sessions, easy runs and LR. Female, 38 and thin. Any recs? Iâ€™ve never tried super shoes, but Iâ€™m totally open to trying them! I just donâ€™t know which ones.","Vaporfly, Invincible"
https://www.reddit.com/r/Nike/comments/1gmemlh/i_need_advice_for_a_new_pair_of_running_shoes/,"My current running shoes are pretty beat up and I'm looking for a new pair, but I have a problem with some running shoes. I usually wear shoes with good arch (normal, and I find Nike perfect), and stable midsole. They should have balance and midsole durability. By durability I mean those that not lean to one side over time. I have this problem with my right foot. (only model this did not happen was Pegasus 39). So anyone have any advice/suggestion on what I should pic (recommand a few because some maynot be available here).","Structure, Air Max 270"
https://www.reddit.com/r/Nike/comments/1b7903w/need_recommendations/,Iâ€™m on my feet ðŸ¦¶ for about 14 miles a day for 6 days a week. Does anyone know or any Nike enthusiast who can recommend me to some good sneakers? I currently only wear Pegasus or Pegasus trails and they seem to work wonders especially with my plantar fasciitis but Iâ€™m noticing that Iâ€™m breaking down the shoes a lot more faster than I thought.,Invincible

A shoe so good you could climb a mountain carrying two armfuls of dirty plates and not feel a single toe cramp or sore heel.",Dansko
