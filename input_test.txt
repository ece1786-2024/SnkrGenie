I’m on my feet 🦶 for about 14 miles a day for 6 days a week. Does anyone know or any Nike enthusiast who can recommend me to some good sneakers?

I don’t care about price, I don’t care about looks, what shoe would you spend 24 hours in and not feel a THING. A shoe so good you could climb a mountain carrying two armfuls of dirty plates and not feel a single toe cramp or sore heel.
